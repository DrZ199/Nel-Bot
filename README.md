### Installation

1. **Clone and install dependencies**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd nelsongpt
   bun install  # or npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Update `.env` with your API keys:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

   VITE_MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key
   VITE_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_huggingface_api_key
   ```

3. **Database Setup**
   - Create a new Supabase project
   - Enable the `vector` extension in SQL Editor
   - Run the SQL commands from `schema.txt` to create tables
   - The schema includes sample medical data to get started

4. **Development Server**
   ```bash
   bun dev  # or npm run dev
   ```
   
   Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

5. **Build for Production**
   ```bash
   bun build  # or npm run build
   ```

## üè• Medical Use Cases
